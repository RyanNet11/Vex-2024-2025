notes to manipulate direction of robot:
    
    to direction amniwheels have to go use a vector from controller 
    have to solve for direction and magnitude 
    we get x component form axis 1 and y from axis 2
    use linear tansformation to get new component vectors for the motor control
    (three blue one brown)  
    apply components to vectors

    make compents into vector 
    multiply by vector  [sqrt2/2,-sqrt2]
                    [sqrt2/2, sqrt2]

    that only gives the new vector of travel 
    instead do this thing in this desmos graph https://www.desmos.com/calculator/eibbwpqeyp
    not the effect we desired it only turned the point 45 degrees without giving any component info 
    new equation in the equation for the the distance of a point pependicular to a line TRY TO DERVIVE IT USING CALC IT IS THE
    SHORTEST DISTANCE FROM A POINT TO ANY POINT ON SAID LINE CAN USE MINIMIAZTION EQUATION
                                                         __________
    the equation from the internet is D = |Ax+By+C| / (-/ A^2 + B^2 ) where the extression in the abs is the line in the form Ax+By+C = 0 
    if we run this equation twice, once per wheel axis we will get two vectors one per motor pairing    

    think about using linear algebra dont know the terms but heard of concept the Av1 + Bv2 = v3 where v3 in the vector of the controller 
    vector one and two are the vectors for the axis of the motor sets the code would solve for A and B and apply those scalings to the vectors
    of the motors velocities we can also trnsform this to three dimensions for cool robot arm also the vectors are easier to change for smth  
    like drone mode 

    A<v1x,v1y> + B<v2x,v2y> = <x,y> : use code to solve this equation for some x,y from the controller A(v1x) + B(v2x) = x
                                                                                                       A(v1y) + B(v2y) = y  solve system 

                                                                                                slove the system on paper its super 
                                                                                                fucking convoluted in the end you get 
            B = {x - (v1x)(v1y)(x)} / {(v2y) - (v1x)(v1y)(v2x)}
            A = {(v2y)x - (v1x)(v1y)(v2x)x - (v2x)y - (v1x)(v1y)(v2x)x} / {(v1x)(v2y) - (v1x)(v1y)(v2x)(v1x)}

            this is the second derivation with not convoluted variables 

            Aq + Bp = x   A<q,r> + B<p,s> = <x,y>
            Ar + Bs = y 

            A = (yp - sx) / (pr - qs)
            B = ((pr - qs)x - (ypq - sxq)) / ((pr - qs)p)

    this method is basicly the same with doing it logically and increasing speed solely based on controller values but with some brainstorming 
    we can use inverse kinematics to add an extra layer of redundancy. 
    WE CAN USE THIS TO AUTOMATICALLY SET THE POSISTION OF THE ROBOT TO CLIMB AT THE END OF THE GAME
    it might be better to logic it out we will have to do some funny value clamping to achieve this we should calulate the time it takes to
    do both calcualtions 

PID controller notes:

    we should make a custom pid for our motors tune per each specific use case 
    look up the wiki page if you wanna know the standard form (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller)

    in regards to tuning it would be cool to do some calculus neral network type shit.
    basiclly we would create a scoring function were we are trying to achieve the smallest 
    the score would be based on a time to get to setpoint and osilations(idk how to spell that) around the setpoint 
    then we would take a 3d derivative and find the minimum of the fuction to set the parameters. 
    the function would have three inputs all coresponding to each pisd term the output of the function would be the score and the 
    final step would be to learn 3d calculus to minimizes that function.
